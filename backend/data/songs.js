    content: `What's in a kiss
            Have you ever wondered just what it is
            More perhaps than just a moment of bliss
            Tell me what's in a kiss
            What's in a dream
            Is it all the things you'd like to have been
            All the places that you haven't yet seen
            Tell me what's in a dream
            I know it's really rather stupid of me
            But I honestly don't know
            Every time I try to find a solution
            I'm surprised at how quickly I become so slow
            What's in a kiss
            Have you ever wondered just what it is
            More perhaps than just one moment of bliss
            Tell me what's in a kiss
            Any time you need a light refreshment
            Baby you can count on me
            I am your very own delicatessen
            Well equipped to supply you with your every need
            What's in a kiss
            Have you ever wondered just what it is
            More perhaps than just one moment of bliss
            Tell me what's in a kiss
            Tell me what's in a kiss
            Tell me what's in a kiss...`,

            Who will remember
            When this is blown over
            And everything's all by the way? (Ooh, yeah)
            When I grow older
            I will be there at your side to remind you
            How I still love you (I still love you)
